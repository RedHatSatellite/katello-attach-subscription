# katello-attach-subscription

automatically assign subscriptions to hypervisors based on certain rules

## Description

`katello-attach-subscription` can be used to attach specific subscriptions to Katello hosts in Satellite 6. It is needed when you have multiple subscriptions that can be given to your hypervisors but want a more granular assignment than done by default by Satellite 6. You could for example give a specific subscription to a set of hosts that match a common hostname pattern or were submitted by a specific `virt-who` instance.

When run, `katello-attach-subscription` will execute the following steps:

* Iterate over all content hosts of type `Hypervisor` of your organization
* Search for a subscription that matches by hostname and (optionally) by the submitter (usually identified by the UUID of the `virt-who` instance)
* If such a subscription is found:
    * ensure that it is attached to the content host
    * and all other subscriptions are removed from it

## Requirements

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* [Apipie Bindings](https://github.com/Apipie/apipie-bindings)

## Options

* `-U`, `--uri=URI` URI to the Satellite, this must be https
* `-u`, `--user=USER` User to log in to Satellite
* `-p`, `--pass=PASS` Password to log in to Satellite
* `-o`, `--organization-id=ID` ID of the Organization
* `-c`, `--config=FILE` configuration in YAML format
* `-n`, `--noop` do not actually execute anything
* `-H`, `--used-hypervisors-only` only search for hypervisors that are in use
* `-s`, `--search=SEARCH` only search for hypervisors that are in use
* `--use-cache` read systems from the cache
* `--cache-file=FILE` set the cache file for reading and writing
* `-d`, `--debug` show debug code during execution

## Configuration

`katello-attach-subscription` can be configured using an YAML file (`katello-attach-subscription.yaml` by default).

The configuration file consists of two main sections: `settings` and `subs`.

The `settings` section allows to set the same details as the commandline options. Any options given on the command line will override the respective config file settings.

    :settings:
      :user: admin
      :pass: changeme
      :uri: https://localhost
      :org: 1
      :cachefile: 'katello-attach-subscription.cache'

The `cachefile` is meant to run this program in a faster way because retrieving all of the systems can require huge time.
The `cachefile` will be written each time, while if `--use-cache` is specified on command line it will be readed and will skip systems extraction.

The `subs` section is an array of hashes which describe the subscriptions to be attached.
Each subscription hash has an `hostname` entry which will be used as an regular expression to match the hostname of the content host in Katello.
It also has a `sub` entry, which is an hash of array.
The hash has product as key, which is a string to identify the type of subscription, and the content is an array of RedHat Pool ID of subscription to be attached to the host.
An optional `registered_by` entry can be given to limit the matching to hosts that were submitted by a specific other host (a value of `null` or `~` skips check). This is the uid of the system running `virt-who` that has registered the `hostname` in Satellite.
The `type` entry can be set if the host in question is not a hypervisor, but should get a subscription.

    :subs:
      - 
        hostname: esxi[0-9]\.example\.com
        registered_by: "85e65e06-a117-4e8e-8aa1-72cb1e00b930"
        sub:
          rhel:
            - 4543828edcf35158c30abc3554c1e36a
            - 5543828edcf35158c30abc3554c1e36b

## Permissions

The following permissions are required to run `katello-attach-subscription`:

| Resource | Permissions |
|----------|-------------|
| Fact Value | view_facts|
| Host | view_hosts, edit_hosts|
| Subscription | view_subscriptions, attach_subscriptions, unattach_subscriptions|


## Caveats

Currently Satellite is not able to save fact that contain the socket number. Candlepin 2.0 (bug to be linked) and `Virt-who` 0.16 are needed `https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1307024`.
Assumption that only 1 sub is needed is done currently.
